# Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) - 8259 Architecture

## Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) modeled after the 8259 architecture using Verilog hardware description language. The 8259 PIC is an essential component in computer systems, responsible for managing and prioritizing interrupt requests from various peripherals, ensuring efficient communication with the CPU.

## Key Features

- **Interrupt Management:** Handles multiple interrupt requests, prioritizes them, and delivers them to the CPU based on predefined criteria.
- **8259 Architecture:** Faithful implementation of the 8259 architecture, ensuring compatibility and functionality akin to real-world PICs.
- **Verilog Implementation:** Designed using Verilog, a hardware description language (HDL) widely used for modeling electronic systems.

## Project Details

- **Architecture:** Based on the Intel 8259 PIC architecture.
- **Language:** Implemented in Verilog for accurate simulation and synthesis of the PIC.
- **Functionality:** Supports interrupt vectoring, masking, and cascading of multiple PICs for extended interrupt management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To work with this project, you will need:

- **Verilog Compiler/Simulator:** Tools such as ModelSim, Xilinx ISE, or Vivado.
- **Hardware Simulation Environment:** An environment to run and test the Verilog code.
